# Know_Your_Health_Better
 I have used dataset of 60+ years old people to study and implement the ML model. After traing and testing I have created the fucntion which takes input values for parameters and based on previous learning from model it predicts the ouput as probable disease that an patient can have.
 
 We have given problem statement about helping the Sunita(65 years old lady) for live healthy life. For that purpose I am going with ML tools. I have found Dataset of 60+ years old people history which has certian observations if someone has specific symptoms then there will be chance of having certian disease. Now by using this idea I have trained ML model on this dataset and get predictable model(model.predict) funtion.
Now when sunita will enter about what she is facing(issues) the model(function) will predict the disease that sunita most probably will have. 
This will help Sunita to know about her health and then draw concern to her medical doctor about this situations.

Pros/future_scope:
Single window platform where one can get status about health.
By increasing the dataset specifically female orinted one can get better result on it.
Deployment of this project will ease the work of UI.

Cons:
One has to enter rigorously 132 prametres values to get results.
